If you're under 22 and have an interest in making your own music, we'd love to hear about it. During our UK tour we want to make sure that all young people with an interest in making their music are able to come to our gigs and see an example of people making high quality music of their own initiative, so we're offering to subsidise a limited number of tickets by 50% of the price you'd be paying otherwise.

<strong>To get the subsidised price, just quote "under 22 offer" when you get to the ticketing desk for the event</strong>, and you'll only be charged half the price you would otherwise pay. This offer is limited to 60 tickets for the remaining tour dates, so arrive early to ensure that you don't miss out.

After the gig, all members of Scrapbook will be around to talk about making music and how we got into positions where we are able to play new innovative music at a professional level, so come and talk to us!
